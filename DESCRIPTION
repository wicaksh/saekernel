Description: Propose an area-level, non-parametric regression estimator based on Nadaraya-Watson kernel on small area mean. Adopt a two-stage estimation approach proposed by Prasad and Rao (1990). MSE estimators are not readily available, so resampling method that called bootstrap is applied. This package are based on the model proposed in Two stage non-parametric approach for small area estimation by Pushpal Mukhopadhyay and Tapabrata Maiti.
